**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

* City Explorer app is an app design to allow users to type in any city in the US and get Longitude, Latitude and a map of that location. The app uses LocationIQ API to display the map and latitude & loangitude of selected locations. The app also display Weather data for three cities which inlude Paris, Arman and Seattle

## Getting Started

* Designing this app starts with the creation of a basic react app using npx create-react-app. This is followed by creating a component 'CityExplorer' or whichever name is relevant. The designer needs to get a key from the LocationIQ website and read documentation on how to use that API. The designer will need to include .env in the gitignore and create a .env file, where they will store the key to safeguard it from the public. Once appropriate url are generated using locationIQ key and all needed information, this url can be used to update state,which should have been created after the creation of the basic react app

## Architecture

This app was designed using React Library,react-bootstrap, css, javascript and html.LocationIQ API is also used.

## Change Log

* 7/28/2021 21:02 - the application can access locationIQ API and render results to users. The application also receives  weather data from locat server
